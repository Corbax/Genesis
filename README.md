Sublime Text Snippets for Genesis WordPress Framework

Currently these snippets are to be downloaded and placed inside a folder on your computer to use them. These can not be downloaded from Sublime Text's package manager (yet). If you are familiar with [submitting a Sublime Text package](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/submitting_a_package) and would like to help, please get in touch.


## How to Install

1. Sublime Text > Preferences > Browse Packages
2. Go inside `User` folder
3. Click on the 'Download ZIP' button at the right to download a zip file of all the snippets. Extract the zip file and copy the extracted folder to the above `User` folder. You may want to rename the folder from `Genesis-master` to just `Genesis`.


## How to Use

Press Cmd + Shift + P (on Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + P (on PC) when you are inside Sublime Text and start typing the Genesis code snippet that you would like to insert.

When you find the match (or after you have pressed the up/down arrow key to select one) hit return to paste the snippet at the cursor location.

Note that most of the snippets work only in PHP files.
